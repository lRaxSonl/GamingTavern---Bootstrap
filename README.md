This is my school project, to start, you need to download python 3.10.5 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/

Next, you need to go to the directory with the project and enter this command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can start the project, you can start "start.bat" or enter this command: python serv.py

And go to 127.0.0.1:5000
